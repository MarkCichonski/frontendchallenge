Create an HTML intranet page for a company called "CDO to GO".  I want 5 sections as follows: Section 1: Text that says "Welcome <first name>".  A search bar underneath that.  Underneath the search bar, I want small buttons: Request forms, Templates, Applications, Employee Handbook, Marketing Collateral, Policies and Procedures, Projects, SOPs.  Section 2: Larger Buttons that lead to other pages.  These buttons would be: Time Sheets, Time Off, Expenses, Holidays, Benefits, Directory, IT Help Desk, Projects.  Section 3: 2 parts side by side; Part 1 is a documents section with buttons for: Request Forms, Applications, Templates, Projects, Employee Handbook, Policies and Procedures, Marketing Collateral, SOPs.  Put a search bar above those buttons to search for documents.  Part 2 is a calendar widget with some example events.  Section 4: A "What's New" section with 3 examples in a small picture format.  Section 5: 2 parts side by side; Part 1 is a "Welcomes" section.  Please create 3 example employees with small bios.  Part 2 is Anniversaries. Please create 5 example employees with anniversary date and years of service.
